Fr8 is a cloud workflow solution. It provides an easy-to-use environment where users can move information easily between their cloud services.  Here's an example of a Fr8 Plan that carries out a DocuSign mail merge using a Google Sheet:

###   Hubs and Terminals: Where Work Gets Done  

Fr8 Plans are assembled out of individual Activities, represented by the cards that you see above.  

###  Crates and Containers: Where Data Lives  

When you run a Plan, Fr8 creates a Container to hold your data. Inside the container your data is sotred in Crates. The main Fr8 service routes the Container as it travels from Activity to Activity.
