Permissions are generally associated with Users via Profiles. The Standard Fr8 User Profile, for example, causes a user to receive Edit Object
permission on all objects they create.

Fr8 currently supports these permissions:

1. Create Object
2. Read Object
3. Edit Object
4. Delete Object
5. Run Object
6. View All Objects
7.  Modify All Objects
8. Manage Fr8 Users
9. Manage Internal Users
