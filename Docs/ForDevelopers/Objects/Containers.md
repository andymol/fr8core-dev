# CONTAINERS

When data is moved around the Fr8 network as part of the execution of a Fr8 Plan, it does so inside of Containers. Containers are like real-world Containers:  they can contain lots of Drates and make sure that all of those Crates travel together. Each Container represents one execution of one Fr8 Plan.  Containers don’t have any smarts, though. They’re data structures. The actual manipulation of Containers, such as shipping them from one Terminal to another Terminal, is always done by a Fr8 Hub.

Fr8 Hubs move Containers from place to place.
