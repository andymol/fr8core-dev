Users are automatically put in an Organization when they register. If they wish, they can act as System Administrator and add and manage other accounts in that Organization.

All others users will have “Member Of That Organization” Role with standard user privileges, that can manage only their own Fr8 Objects.

Organization settings can be edited by System Administrators from the ‘Organization’ pane inside user account.
