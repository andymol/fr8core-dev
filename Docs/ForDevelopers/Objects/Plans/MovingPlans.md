Moving and Sharing Plans
========================

[Plan JSON](/Docs/ForDevelopers/Objects/Plans/PlanJSONDefinition.md) is designed to be portable. You can download it and then upload it into a different Hub, and it should work. 

There are few ways to download the plan:

### Using plan details page 

1. On this page (reachable from [here](https://fr8.co/dashboard/myaccount)) click on *Settings* button:  
![Plan settings button](/Docs/img/MovePlans.PlanSettingsButton.png)  
2. Click *Download* button in the page that will open:  
![Plan settings button]/Docs/img/MovePlans.DownloadPlanButton.png)  
Plan JSON will be downloaded as the file by your browser.



### Using plan builder

You can open plan details page directly from the Plan Builder:

You can also share a Plan with others by publishing it to the [Plan Directory](/Docs/ForDevelopers/OperatingConcepts/PlanDirectory.md).
