# SUBPLANS

Every Plan is made up of 1 or more Subplans. A default Plan has a single, unnamed Subplan. Users can optionally add additional Subplans and name them.

Subplans enable the user to add more structure to their Plan. The primary example is branching. A user can add a Test and Branch activity to their Plan that creates the equivalent of an If/Then statement: If the value of this cell in the spreadsheet is greater than 500, then execute the set of Activities in Subplan “Approval Process – Large Amounts”, else execute the set of Activities in Subplan “Approval Process – Small Amounts”.

Subplans allow the creation of reusable blocks of functionality inside of a single Plan.
