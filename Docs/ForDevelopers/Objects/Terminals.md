# TERMINALS
[Back to Home](/Docs/Home.md)

Terminals are discrete Web Services that host Action functionality.

The main fr8 Hub runs many of these Terminals itself, but the architecture is decoupled: as far as the Hub is concerned, each Terminal is on the other end of an HTTP request. A fully operational Hub may work with hundreds of different Terminals.

The Hub at fr8.co currently features with Terminals that have been written in C#, Java, Ruby, and Python.
