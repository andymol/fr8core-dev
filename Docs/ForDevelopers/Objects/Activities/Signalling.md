# ACTIVITIES â€“ SIGNALING 
[Go to Contents](/Docs/Home.md) 

Activities signal information in several ways:

1.  They signal the UI they want shown to users by configuring a Crate of UI Controls and addit it to the Activity JSON.
2.  At Run-time, they signal their preferred flow control by providing [Activity Responses](/Docs/ForDevelopers/Objects/Activities/ActivityResponses.md) in their HTTP responses. These can have dramatic effects like shutting down the entire Plan.
3.  At Design-time, they [signal the Crates and Fields that they intend to make available at Run-Time](/Docs/ForDevelopers/OperatingConcepts/Signaling.md), so that downstream Activities can respond (for example, by enabling mapping from one field to another).
