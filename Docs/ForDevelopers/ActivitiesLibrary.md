These special activities are part of the core Fr8 set:

## App Builder

### ACTIVITY â€“ App Builder

This special and powerful activity allows the generation of Fr8 Apps, miniature applications that can be distributed to others, allowing them to run the application without dealing with the Fr8 Plan Builder complexity.

Collect Data makes use of Views, the ability of Activities to show different sets of UI depending on circumstances. The first View corresponds to Builder Mode, and allows the Power User to assemble a form from a set of form metacontrols:

The set of available UI controls is small but growing:

![Control_Chooser](https://github.com/Fr8org/Fr8Core/blob/master/Docs/img/ActivitiesLibrary_Control_Chooser.png)

Running this activity results in the generation of a Collection Mode Plan URL, which is pushed to the client and shown in the Activity Stream:

![Collect_Data_2](https://github.com/Fr8org/Fr8Core/blob/master/Docs/img/ActivitiesLibrary_Collect_Data_2.png)

This URL can be distributed to others. It runs the same plan but it runs it in Kiosk View and Collection Mode.

Collection Mode means that the user sees the UI produced by the Collection view on the Collect Data Activity. The metacontrols are replaced with the controls they represent:

![Collect_Data_3](https://github.com/Fr8org/Fr8Core/blob/master/Docs/img/ActivitiesLibrary_Collect_Data_3.png)

Kiosk Mode causes the client to show nothing but those activities that are tagged as being viewable in Kiosk Mode. The value of this is more apparent once we add some downstream processing to our Collect Data activity.
