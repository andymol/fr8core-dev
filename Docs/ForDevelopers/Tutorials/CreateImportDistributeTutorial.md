# TUTORIAL: CREATE A FR8 PLAN, IMPORT SPREADSHEET DATA, AND DISTRIBUTE THE DATA BY AN EMAIL ACTIVITY

Fr8 easily and efficiently retrieves, loads, and integrates data from multiple web sources into Fr8 plans where it is available for processing, storage, and distribution.

In this example you are going to create a plan, retrieve and load data from a Google Sheet into your plan, and distribute the data by generating an Email Activity.

Here’s how it’s done:

1. Click “My Account” after logging in:

3. Name and describe your plan. Be as specific as possible so that you can easily identify it when you have a number of plans in your account. Click “Save Changes”:

4. Click  “+” to see activity options. Don’t worry about “Inactive” status. Your plan remains “Inactive” until you “Run” it and complete the Email Activity:
