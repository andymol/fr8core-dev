Hub Development on .NET
=======================


The .NET repo of Fr8 includes both a large set of Terminals and an implementation of a Hub.

You can choose to run the Hub locally or even deploy it to your own public server. The tradeoffs are discussed [here](/Docs/ForDevelopers/DevelopmentGuides/ChoosingADevelopmentApproach.md).
