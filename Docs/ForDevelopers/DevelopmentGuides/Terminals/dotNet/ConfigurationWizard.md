Configuration Wizard
====================

The Fr8 Hub needs to be setup with an administrative account before it can be properly used. This is configured in the configuration wizard, which
runs at home/index the first time the Hub is run.

The Hub will check for an existing Fr8 Account with the Fr8 Admin role. If it does not find one, it will redirect to the wizard, allowing you to setup an master administrative account.

This master administrative account once created, will be configured as default system user account. That system user account is used for running internal Fr8 plans, like monitoring manifest registry submissions and processing events.
