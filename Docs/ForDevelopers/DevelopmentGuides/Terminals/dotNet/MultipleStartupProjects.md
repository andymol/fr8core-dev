Starting Multiple Projects
==========================

When running Fr8 from Visual Studio, you need to start multiple projects. To begin with, there's HubWeb, which is the main Hub service. 
You also need to start any Terminals you want to make use of. 

To specify your startup projects , right click the Fr8 solution in the Solution Explorer and select the Properties item from the dropdown menu.
Unless you start a Terminal, its Activities will not be visible in the Client.
